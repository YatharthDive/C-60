                <p>Robert Downey Jr who is mostly known by fan as Iron Man is one of the most expensive actor currently. But, he was not the man we know him as now as his story and struggles goes far beyond. So, as my first Inspirational Stories I wanted to write his story down.Robert Downey Jr was born in 4th of April in 1965. His father Rober Downy Sr was an actor and filmmaker himself who was best known as underground filmmaker. Robert Downy Jr made his first debut at the age of five in a movie made by his father. From his early childhood he was surrounded by drugs as his father was drug addict himself who gave Robert his first Marijuana at the age of six.

                    Robert started to pursue his career from small theaters roles and soon began to grow from their. He got a part as a youngster in a show Saturday Night Live but he was often criticized. He was fired after an year due to his low ratings. He was struggling with his career until he got some attention from movies like The Pick up Artist and Less then Zero. He starred as famous comedian Charlie Chaplin in movie Chaplin in 1992. Robert was one of nominees in Academy Awards for Best Actor but he didn't win it.

                    He appeared in several movies but he wasn't successful yet. His career hit real low as he was arrested multiple times for drug use between 1996-2000. He was having trouble with his life as he had to attend Prison and Rehab during that time. His marriage was also going very bad at that time due to his high drug use.Robert started to get back in his career as a Larry Paul in a television series Ally McBeal. He was praised for his acting and his ratings were good. But again due to his drug use he was again arrested. He met his current wife Susan Nicole Downey in 2003 and gain strength from her. From her support he was finally able to move on from his past and he got back in his career starting in movies like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Zodiac.

                    But in 2007, his career took a big hit as he starred as Tony Stark in a blockbuster movie Iron Man. Marvel Cinematic Universe who were struggling themselves have found a perfect match for them. Robert was so fit for the role of Tony Stark as fans loved the movie and the movie made a lot of money from it. His role Iron Man was also not very famous among the comic book fans. Robert's acting and attitude was able to establish himself and Iron Man as one of the fan favorites.</p>
